# User Management System

In this User Management System project, I designed, implemented a robust, distributed and secure system that offers user authentication and management, using Golang, MySQL, Redis. The project was deployed using Docker and load-tested using K6s, which shows good performance. A single instance of commodity hardware can achieve 1K requests per second.

## Documentation

Most time and efforts are spent on system design for the project. Documentation is available on [Notion](https://hxt365.notion.site/User-Management-System-Golang-2c7aaeb9b35a4ca2b63eff2c495c3d62)
